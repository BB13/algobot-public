# AlgoBot Documentation Hub

This folder contains curated documentation that explains how AlgoBot is structured and how its moving parts collaborate at runtime. The guides are organised for portfolio reviewâ€”each page is self-contained and cross-references relevant modules inside the repository.

## Table of contents

1. [Architecture & runtime orchestration](architecture.md)
2. [Signal processing & trade lifecycle](trade-lifecycle.md)
3. [Background maintenance & safeguards](background-jobs.md)
4. [Configuration, data stores, and logging](operations.md)
5. [Operator interfaces](interfaces.md)

## Navigation tips

- Each guide begins with a **"Why it matters"** section to explain its impact on the overall trading flow.
- Module links use relative GitHub-friendly paths so reviewers can jump straight into the code.
- Appendices call out related utilities or scripts worth reviewing when touching that area.
